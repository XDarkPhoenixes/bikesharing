## Summary

It is not hard to notice that Thursday is the most popular day to take a bike ride. Pay extra attention to bike management during peak hours should reduce bike shortages.Promoting customers to become long-term subscribers is important not only because most trips are taken by subscribers but also reducing the number of unknowns for gender as shown by the additional visualization. Getting the big picture of which part of the city is more popular with bike rides could gain more insight and manage bike station placement better. Since less bike ride is longer than an hour, the range of the outer bike station should be adjusted accordingly.
